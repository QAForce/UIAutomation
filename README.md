# UIAutomation
A web UI automation tool which is built in command-based architecture on windows console platform

Why I built this tool!?
In my department, the backgroud of our QA members are almost lack of coding ability.
So most of testing works are based on human manually testing, expecially in the web test.
However, here are the problems,
Our projects are always tight however the web test alwasy needs a lot human annd time resource to keep quality beacuse the functions are complex.
It's fine to create automation test of API, because the change frequency of API is not so high like the web and we just
need to find some one (one or two maybe...) coding on that due to the specification of API is fixed.
Only you need to do is create the automation program once and the change is the input data.

This is not work on web test, the user behavior is complex and the code need to be changed frequently due to the scenario change or function change or UI change.

So...all in all, this tool want to archieve these goals:
1. Easy to use for anyone who is lack of coding ability. The creation of UI automation test won't need to touch coding.
2. Create an automation test scenario should be very quickly.
3. High flexibility for furture extend. (It's all XML file-based)
4. Low loading on maintainence.

The feature of this tool:
1. All XML-Based file management
2. Support MS SQL DB operation, Javascript, and Restful API
3. Support IE/Firfox/Chrome now (It is easy to involve other brwosers)
4. Use the concept of command/virtual command to combine an UI behavior scenario by user want.
